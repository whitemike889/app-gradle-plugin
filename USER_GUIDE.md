# User Guide 2.+

| NOTE             |
| :---------------- |
| The behavior of the appengine-gradle-plugin has changed since v1.+; please see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of changes. If you are having trouble using or updating your plugin, please file a [new issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin/issues).|

## Applying the Plugin
Include the plugin jar in your buildscript classpath and apply the appropriate plugin:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "com.google.cloud.tools:appengine-gradle-plugin:<version>"
  }
}

apply plugin: "com.google.cloud.tools.appengine" // for automatic environment determination
// or
apply plugin: "com.google.cloud.tools.appengine-appenginewebxml"
// or
apply plugin: "com.google.cloud.tools.appengine-appyaml"
```

When you use the `com.google.cloud.tools.appengine` plugin it will automatically determine
your environment based on the presence of an `appengine-web.xml`
in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/`. It will enable _`appengine-appenginewebxml`_ if present, _`appengine-appyaml`_ otherwise.

The [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) is required for this plugin to
function. Download and install it before running any tasks.

your application using the defaults provided by the plugin. To view the default configuration values, run :

```
$ ./gradlew appengineShowConfiguration
```

If you wish to customize the plugin further, the plugin can be configured using the `appengine`
configuration closure.

```groovy
appengine {
  tools {
    // configure the Cloud Sdk tooling
  }
  run {
    // configure local run
  }
  stage {
    // configure staging for deployment
  }
  deploy {
    // configure deployment
  }
}
```

### How do I deploy my project Configuration Files?

You can now deploy index.yaml/dos.yaml/etc for all environments.

Use the following tasks :
* `appengineDeployCron`
* `appengineDeployDispatch`
* `appengineDeployDos`
* `appengineDeployIndex`
* `appengineDeployQueue`

The deployment source directory can be overridden by setting the `appEngineDirectory` parameter
in the deploy configuration.

For appengine-web.xml based projects, it defaults to `${buildDir}/staged-app/WEB-INF/appengine-generated`.
You should not change this configuration; this is the location that your xml configs are converted
into yaml for deployment.

```groovy
appengine {
  deploy {
    appEngineDirectory = "my/custom/appengine/project/configuration/directory"
  }
}
```

### How do I debug Dev Appserver v1?

You can debug the Dev App Server v1 using the jvmFlags :

```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    jvmFlags = ["-Xdebug", "-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"]
  }
}
```

### How do I enable automatic reload of my application?

To enable automatic reload of your application:
1. You must tell the Dev App Server v1 to scan for changes :
    ```groovy
    appengine {
      run {
        automaticRestart = true
      }
    }
    ```
2. While your app is running, just run `explodeWar` to copy the changes into the exploded app directly and reflect your changes into the running application.

If you wish to try gradle's experimental `--continuous` for automatic change application, see [#174](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin/issues/174).

### How do I put datastore somewhere else (so it's not deleted across rebuilds)?
```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    jvmFlags = ["-Ddatastore.backing_store=/path/to/my/local_db.bin"]
  }
}
```

### How do I run multiple modules on the Dev App Server v1?

Multimodule support can be done by adding all the runnable modules to a single runner's configuration (which currently
must be an appengine-web.xml based application), and using a helper method to tie everything together.
```groovy
appengine {
  run {
    // configure the app to point to the right service directories
    services = [
        projectAsService(project),
        projectAsService(":another-module")
    ]
  }
}
```

### I want to use Dev Appserver 2 (alpha), how do I switch to it?

The v2-alpha Dev Appserver is no longer supported from this plugin.
